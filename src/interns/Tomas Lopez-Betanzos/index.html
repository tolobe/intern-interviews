      <p> What is up, my friend? I'm writing this paragraph to explain my intent in applying to this internship. I'm not the young 20s college-aged intern stereotype. I'm transitioning from my established career in finance to the exciting world of fintech.</p>
      <h3>Wait, What?</h3>
      <p>Yeah, I spent over five years in the consumer finance world. Whether working at a non-profit serving folks with few other options, or providing small business owners with a larger pool of customers than they would otherwise reach, I connected people with their financial vision.</p>
      <h3>How is that tech tho?</h3>     
      <p>The transition comes now because I find many of the issues closely abut big data or otherwise more complex issues than I could explain. So I completed a coding boot camp with a focus on Python and Data Science. Now I'm searching for roles that rely on my diverse experiencec and my thirst for continued learning. </p>
